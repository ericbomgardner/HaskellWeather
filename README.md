This is a terrible haskell program designed to get the weather using forecast.io APIs. 

You'll have to insert an API key for forecast.io to get results, or use the pre-built version that works on OSX found in dist/build/.

Use `HaskellWeather -current` to get the current weather (currently hardcoded in to be Charlottesville's weather).
